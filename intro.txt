> BST is a type of binary tree.
> Each subtree is a binary subtree.
> Elements less than the root node lie in the left subtree, whereas Elements greater than the root node lie in 
  right subtree.
> Time complexity for searching = O(Depth of tree)
> Time complexity for inserting = O(Depth of tree)
> Depth of tree in best case = O(logN)
> Depth of tree in worst case = O(N)  [Skew tree case, where all elements lie on one side.]
